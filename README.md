# About

We wanted to make something for the people who could not see or faced a lot of difficulty seeing normally. So, we successfully planned and made eye goggles for them using Arduino as the central unit. These goggles do three things:
1) Made a buzzing vibration whenever someone came in the vicinity.
2) Can do OCR using tesseract and read text in multiple languages. 
3) Detects people's faces whenever they come near it.

Refer to the file in the github to see how we detect the text and its output.
This idea is very unique because:
1) This kind of device does not exist in India.
2) The cost to make this kind of device, even in foreign countries, is very high.
3) A standalone product that does not need internet and is market-ready.
